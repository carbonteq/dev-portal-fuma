title: Headless Document Management System
description: A comprehensive backend training project that teaches clean architecture, domain-driven design, and modern TypeScript development through building a document management system
---

## About the project

Headless API for documents, metadata, permissions, search, and short-lived downloads.
- **Storage:** S3-compatible object store (minio/S3/GCS) + CDN optional.
- **Security:** JWT auth, RBAC (Admin, User), pre-signed URLs, strict input validation.
- **Search:** Filter by tags, metadata (key/value), filename, content-type; pagination & sort.
- **Versioning & Audit:** Immutable file versions, basic audit trail (who/when/what).


## Pre Requisites
- Proficiency in TypeScript (Custom Types, Interfaces, Type Utils, Classes, Generics, etc.)
- Proficiency in Node.js or Bun.js: Concurrency management, Event Loop, and File & Streams.
- Basic Understanding of [12 Factor Apps](https://12factor.net/)
- Functional Programming: Composition, Currying, Higher-Order Functions (HOF), Functors, and Monads

## Kick-Off (Week 1)

### Tasks

**API Endpoints:**
- Build endpoints for uploading documents with metadata.
  - Build endpoint for managing metadata.
  - Build endpoints for managing permissions.
- Introduce JWT-based authentication for securing endpoints.
- Build endpoint for generating short lived download links for files. 
- Implement advanced search filters for documents using tags and metadata.

**Other:**
- Cover gitflow and prepare a custom diagram in figjam. Goal is to visualize SDLC from git flow perspective
- Create services to abstract the logic away from controllers.
- Abstract away ORM model and create a physical store like APIs using repository pattern with interface for stores and their concrete implementation utilizing ORM models.


### Expectations

* Use Express.js or Hono for HTTP framework with traditional REST endpoints.
* Use [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/) for database operations.
* Use application-generated UUIDs instead of database-generated IDs.
* Validate input using [Zod](https://www.npmjs.com/package/zod) schemas.
* Implement JWT-based authentication with middleware.
* Keep controllers thin: validate input, call services, return responses.
* Use repository pattern for data access with interface abstractions.
* Implement pagination with standard options and paginated responses.
* Prefer async/await over promises and callbacks.

<Aside type='note' title='Learning Path' >

This traditional implementation serves as the foundation before learning clean architecture patterns in CA - Part 1 and CA - Part 2.
