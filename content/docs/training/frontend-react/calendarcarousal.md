## Task

Goal is to create an extensive developer friendly API with sane defaults, Key here is to relate to other developers and cover as much use cases as possible.

### Expectations

- All of the calendarâ€™s state management and date logic should be bundled as a custom hook to increase reusability of the logic and modularity of the component.
- Document all possible use cases.
- Document the API clearly.
- Code must be self contained, keep external dependencies to minimal.
- Typechecking on the component API.
- 80% above test coverage.
