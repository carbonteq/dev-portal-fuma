title: Ant Design Chart Customization
---


## Scope

* There should be 2 input fields for x and y-axis values as an array.
* A button for plotting values.
* Users should be able to see the plotted line graph below the input fields.

## Guidelines

* UI should be interactive and responsive.
* Should use Ant Design (antd) charts for the graph.

## Implementation

### Phase 1

#### Tasks

* Explore Graph Documentation.
* Setup Project.
* Typescript with Next.js as the Primary Framework.
* Configure Ant Design UI library.
* Setup Linter.
* Setup Build Scripts.

#### Expectations

* Get familiar with Ant Design charts.
* Get familiar with next.config.js options.
* Follow naming conventions for components and props (Airbnb style guide).

### Phase 2

#### Tasks

* Create an intuitive UI for plotting the graph.
* Allow users to change axis data.
* Allow users to plot the data.
* Plot data on a line graph.

#### Expectations

* Ensure a seamless user experience across various screen sizes and devices (including 5k screens).
* Implement well-defined component patterns (container/layout/UI) and use composition to build a modular and maintainable codebase.
* Axis intersection points should be visible.
* The graph area should be gradient.
* Users should be able to see the axis info on hover over the graph area.

### Phase 3

#### Tasks

* Use a custom tooltip for a better user experience.
* Draw a line parallel to the x-axis position at the average of the y-axis.
* When the user hovers over the average line, a tooltip should be shown showcasing the average of the y-axis.

Expectations

* The custom tooltip should provide clear and concise information about the data point being hovered over, enhancing the user's understanding of the graph.
* The line parallel to the x-axis representing the average of the y-axis values should be accurately positioned and visually distinguishable from other elements on the graph.
* The tooltip triggered by hovering over the average line should display the calculated average of the y-axis values, ensuring users can easily interpret this important metric.

### Phase 4

#### Tasks

* Adjust the axis minimum and maximum values to closely match the actual data values, enhancing visualization accuracy.
* Implement padding on the y-axis, ensuring there is space added at both the top and bottom to prevent the axis's minimum and maximum values from aligning with the graph's edges.
* Configure the primary tooltip activation to trigger only when the mouse cursor approaches or hovers in proximity to the intersection points on the graph.

Expectations

* The axis adjustments should result in a graph where the data points are clearly displayed within the axis limits, providing an accurate representation of the data.
* Padding on the y-axis should create visual separation between the axis limits and the graph edges, preventing any overlap and improving the graph's aesthetic appeal.
* The primary tooltip activation should enhance user interaction by displaying relevant information only when necessary, reducing clutter and improving the overall user experience..
