## [Rotating Caliper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotating_calipers)

The method is so named because the idea is analogous to rotating a spring-loaded [vernier caliper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vernier_caliper) around the outside of a [convex polygon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_polygon). Every time one blade of the caliper lies flat against an edge of the polygon, it forms an [antipodal pair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodal_point) with the point or edge touching the opposite blade. The complete "rotation" of the caliper around the polygon detects all antipodal pairs; the set of all pairs, viewed as a graph, forms a [thrackle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrackle). The method of rotating calipers can be interpreted as the [projective dual](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duality_(projective_geometry)>) of a [sweep line algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweep_line_algorithm) in which the sweep is across slopes of lines rather than across x- or y-coordinates of points.
