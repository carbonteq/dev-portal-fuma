### Linear Interpolation

In mathematics, linear interpolation is a method of [curve fitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve_fitting) using [linear polynomials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_polynomial) to construct new data points within the range of a discrete set of known data points.

### Polynomial Interpolation

In [numerical analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_analysis), polynomial interpolation is the [interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolation) of a given [data set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_set) by the [polynomial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polynomial) of lowest possible degree that passes through the points of the dataset.

**Lagrange Interpolation**

If we are given enough values at specific points, we can use [Lagrange interpolation](https://brilliant.org/wiki/lagrange-interpolation/) to find underlying polynomial

**Spline Interpolation**

[Spline interpolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spline_interpolation) is a form of interpolation where the interpolant is a special type of piecewise polynomial called a spline. That is, instead of fitting a single, high-degree polynomial to all of the values at once, spline interpolation fits low-degree polynomials to small subsets of the values, for example, fitting nine cubic polynomials between each of the pairs of ten points.
