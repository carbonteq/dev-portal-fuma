## Project Organization

Our frontend projects follow a well-structured directory organization that promotes separation of concerns and reusability:

<Files>
  <Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="assets" defaultOpen>
      <File name="images/" />
      <File name="styles/" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="primitives" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="derived" defaultOpen>
          <File name="TopBorderButton/" />
        </Folder>
        <File name="Button/" />
        <File name="Input/" />
        <File name="Card/" />
        <File name="Typography/" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="composites" defaultOpen>
        <Folder name="common" defaultOpen>
          <File name="Header/" />
          <File name="Footer/" />
        </Folder>
        <File name="AddTodoForm/" />
        <File name="TodoList/" />
        <File name="TodoItem/" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="containers" defaultOpen>
      <File name="TodoListContainer/" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="context" defaultOpen>
      <File name="AuthContext.tsx" />
      <File name="ThemeContext.tsx" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="hooks" defaultOpen>
      <File name="useAuth.ts" />
      <File name="useForm.ts" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
      <File name="Home/" />
      <File name="Login/" />
      <File name="Dashboard/" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="services" defaultOpen>
      <File name="api.ts" />
      <File name="auth.ts" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="utils" defaultOpen>
      <File name="helpers.ts" />
      <File name="constants.ts" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <File name="package.json" />
  <File name="tsconfig.json" />
</Files>

The important part here is not to make the directory name a hard and fast rule but to follow a neat organization that anyone in the codebase can understand.

<Aside type="caution" title="Note">
At Carbonteq, we follow a modular and component-based architecture for our frontend applications. The patterns and practices described here are based on experience and may not work for every large-scale application. Take the parts that resonate with you or you think will help you get things more organized in your React project.

## Understanding the Codebase

Each directory in our structure plays a crucial role in creating sufficient abstraction layers between the Presentation Layer, Application Layer, and the Data fetched from backend APIs:

- **Component Organization**: _Pages_ represent the top-level routes and orchestrate the entire user interface. They compose _Containers_, which handle data fetching by calling services and manage state logic. Containers then pass this data down to the _Presentation Layer_ composed of _Composites_ (feature-specific components) and _Primitives_ (atomic, reusable UI elements). This creates a clear abstractions: _Pages_ → _Containers_ → _Composites_ → _Primitives_.
- **Data Fetching**: In _services_ directory, services like authentication, fetching/updating data etc. All interaction with the backend takes place here. It is a best practice to create an abstraction layer over the API client library being used e.g. Axios, it will be easier in future to replace Axios with anyother API client library.
- **State Management**: _Context/Store_ directory stores the data and state of the application, whenever any service is called which returns some useful data, it is stored in the context/store directory which can be accessed later the container components to further pass the data.

## Architecture Breakdown

Scroll through the interactive visualization below to understand how data flows through our frontend architecture layers:

### Components (Deep Dive)

Our component architecture is organized into two distinct categories: `Primitives` and `Composites`.

**Primitives** are the fundamental building blocks of our UI. They are either native HTML elements or components from a UI library like Ant Design or Material UI. Most primitive components, which are mapped directly from a UI library to our application's design system, are placed flat inside the `primitives` directory.

However, some primitives are **derived**. Derived components are used multiple times in the design system, but it doesn't make sense to create a variant for them. A good example is a button with a top border being used at multiple places in the UI. Its primitive (`Button`) exists, but creating a new variant for it doesn't make sense. In such cases, we create a `TopBorderButton` and place it in a `derived` folder inside `primitives`.

**Composites** are components built by combining one or more primitives. They encapsulate business logic and are specific to our application's features. Composites are organized into:
1.  **common**: Components that are reused across multiple features of the application (e.g., a generic `Modal` or `PageLayout`).
2.  Feature-specific components: These are components that belong to a particular feature, like a `TodoItem` or `TodoList` in a todo application.

Here is an example structure for a todo application:

<Files>
  <Folder name="components" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="primitives" defaultOpen>
      <File name="Button/" />
      <File name="Input/" />
      <File name="Checkbox/" />
      <Folder name="derived" defaultOpen>
        <File name="TopBorderButton/" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="composites" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="common" defaultOpen>
        <File name="Modal/" />
      </Folder>
      <Folder name="todo" defaultOpen>
        <File name="TodoItem/" />
        <File name="TodoList/" />
        <File name="AddTodoForm/" />
      </Folder>
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

In this example:
- `Button`, `Input`, `Checkbox` are primitives from a UI library.
- `TopBorderButton` is a derived primitive.
- `Modal` is a common composite component that can be used anywhere in the app.
- `TodoItem`, `TodoList`, and `AddTodoForm` are composite components specific to the todo feature. They would be composed of primitives like `Button`, `Input`, and `Checkbox`.

This structure helps us maintain a clear separation between generic, reusable UI elements and feature-specific, complex components.

### Containers

Containers are higher-level components that:
- Comprise of sub-components
- Handle data fetching through services
- Pass data to corresponding sub-components
- Manage the state and logic for a group of components
- Act as a bridge between the data layer and presentation layer

Example container structure for a todo app:
<Files>
  <Folder name="containers" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="TodoListContainer" defaultOpen>
      <File name="TodoListContainer.tsx" />
      <File name="TodoListContainer.styles.ts" />
      <File name="TodoListContainer.test.tsx" />
      <File name="index.ts" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

Containers follow the container/presentational pattern, where:
- Containers handle the data and logic
- Presentational components (in the components directory) handle the UI
- This separation makes components more reusable and easier to test

### Common Modules

One advantage of React being un-opinionated is it doesn't care how you divide your modules. When developing a page in a React app, consider dividing it into modular pieces. This will help you reduce the complexity and create structures that are open for reusable or shared across the application.

Shareable code in React app should be divided under its own domain. A common module can be reusable common composite components, custom hooks, business logic, constants, and utility functions. These reusable pieces are shared across the application to be used on more than one page component.

### Context/Store

The context directory manages global state using React Context:
- Provides state management for application-wide data
- Implements custom hooks for state access
- Follows the principle of separation of concerns

### Hooks

Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic and state management:
- Follow the "use" naming convention
- Are pure functions that can be composed
- Handle their own state and side effects

Example of a custom hook for managing todos:

```typescript
import { useState } from 'react';

interface Todo {
  id: number;
  text: string;
  completed: boolean;
}

export const useTodos = (initialTodos: Todo[] = []) => {
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState<Todo[]>(initialTodos);

  const addTodo = (text: string) => {
    const newTodo: Todo = {
      id: Date.now(),
      text,
      completed: false,
    };
    setTodos([...todos, newTodo]);
  };

  const toggleTodo = (id: number) => {
    setTodos(
      todos.map(todo =>
        todo.id === id ? { ...todo, completed: !todo.completed } : todo
      )
    );
  };

  return {
    todos,
    addTodo,
    toggleTodo,
  };
};
```

The custom hook `useTodos` above encapsulates the logic for managing the todo list. It handles its own state and exposes methods to modify that state. This hook can be used in the `TodoListContainer` to manage the application's data.

### Pages Component

Pages represent the main routes of the application:
- Compose components and hooks
- Handle routing logic
- Manage page-specific state

### Services

Services handle external communication and data fetching:
- Abstract API calls
- Implement error handling
- Provide type-safe interfaces

## Architecture Principles

Our frontend architecture follows these key principles:

### Separation of Concerns
- **Pages**: Handle routing and page-level orchestration
- **Containers**: Manage data fetching and business logic
- **Components**: Focus on presentation and user interaction
- **Services**: Handle external API communication
- **Hooks**: Encapsulate reusable logic and state management

### Data Flow
The data flows in a predictable pattern:
1. **Pages** compose **Containers**
2. **Containers** use **Services** to fetch data
3. **Containers** use **Hooks** for state management
4. **Containers** pass data to **Components** for presentation
5. **Components** are built from **Primitives** and **Composites**

### Modularity
- Each component has a single responsibility
- Components are composable and reusable
- Logic is extracted into custom hooks
- Services provide clean API abstractions
