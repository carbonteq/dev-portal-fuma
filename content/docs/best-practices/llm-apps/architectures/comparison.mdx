# Architecture Comparison

<Aside type="tip" title="Decision Guide">
Use this comparison to understand when to choose each architecture and how building blocks behave differently in each approach.
</Aside>

## Quick Decision Matrix

| Factor | Chatbot-Based | Workflow-Based |
|--------|---------------|----------------|
| **Primary Use Case** | Real-time conversation | Multi-step business processes |
| **Latency** | < 2.5s response time | Minutes to hours |
| **User Interaction** | Interactive, conversational | Batch processing, async |
| **Complexity** | Simple to moderate | Moderate to high |
| **Audit Requirements** | Basic logging | Full audit trails |
| **Human-in-the-Loop** | Optional | Often required |
| **Scalability** | High concurrent users | High throughput processing |

## Detailed Comparison

### Use Cases

#### Chatbot-Based
* **Customer support** and help desks
* **Interactive assistants** and virtual agents
* **Real-time Q&A** systems
* **Conversational interfaces** for applications
* **Educational tutoring** systems
* **Creative collaboration** tools

#### Workflow-Based
* **Document processing** pipelines
* **Content generation** workflows
* **Data analysis** and reporting
* **Compliance** and audit processes
* **Multi-step approvals** and reviews
* **Batch processing** operations

<Aside type="note" title="Hybrid Approach">
Many systems combine both architectures - using chatbots for user interaction and workflows for backend processing.
</Aside>

### Performance Characteristics

#### Latency
* **Chatbot:** p95 < 1.5â€“2.5s with streaming
* **Workflow:** Minutes to hours depending on complexity

#### Throughput
* **Chatbot:** High concurrent users (thousands)
* **Workflow:** High batch processing (millions of items)

#### Resource Usage
* **Chatbot:** CPU-intensive per request
* **Workflow:** Memory-intensive for large datasets

### Building Block Behavior

| Building Block | Chatbot-Based | Workflow-Based |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Prompts** | Turn-scoped, streaming-friendly, tool schemas inline | Step-scoped, deterministic, strict schemas, low temperature |
| **Agents** | Single orchestrator, pre/post processors, telemetry hooks | Orchestrator + workers, state transforms, step hooks |
| **LLM Guards** | Lightweight, fast checks, interactive fallbacks | Hard gates, retry/human review, audited decisions |
| **Evals** | Online sampling, A/B testing, real-time alerts | Step gates, regression packs, quality budgets |
| **RAG** | On-demand retrieval, session filters, caching | Stage-specific retrieval, pre-ingestion, artifact storage |
| **Memory** | Conversation + short-term TTL, user preferences | Run context + artifacts, durable TTL, cross-run caches |
| **Operational** | p95 latency, cost per turn, chat observability | Exactly-once effects, queue health, run timelines |
